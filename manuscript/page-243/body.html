The Virtuous.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">With thunder and heavenly fireworks must one speak to indolent and somnolent senses.</p><p>But beauty’s voice speaketh gently: it appealeth only to the most awakened souls.</p><p>Gently vibrated and laughed unto me to-day my buckler; it was beauty’s holy laughing and thrilling.</p><p>At you, ye virtuous ones, laughed my beauty to-day. And thus came its voice unto me: “They want—to be paid besides!”</p><p>Ye want to be paid besides, ye virtuous ones! Ye want reward for virtue, and heaven for earth, and eternity for your to-day?</p></div> </div>
