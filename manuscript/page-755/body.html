   From mine own truth-insanity,
   From mine own fervid day-longings,
   Of day aweary, sick of sunshine,
   —Sunk downwards, evenwards, shadowwards:
   By one sole trueness
   All scorched and thirsty:
   —Bethinkst thou still, bethinkst thou, burning heart,
   How then thou thirstedest?—</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
