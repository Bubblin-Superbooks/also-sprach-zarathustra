Lo! the pale criminal hath bowed his head: out of his eye speaketh the great contempt.</p><p>“Mine ego is something which is to be surpassed: mine ego is to me the great contempt of man”: so speaketh it out of that eye.</p><p>When he judged himself—that was his supreme moment; let not the exalted one relapse again into his low estate!</p><p>There is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from himself, unless it be speedy death.</p></div> </div>
