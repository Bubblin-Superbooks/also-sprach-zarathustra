The Sublime Ones.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Calm is the bottom of my sea: who would guess that it hideth droll monsters!</p><p>Unmoved is my depth: but it sparkleth with swimming enigmas and laughters.</p><p>A sublime one saw I to-day, a solemn one, a penitent of the spirit: Oh, how my soul laughed at his ugliness!</p><p>With upraised breast, and like those who draw in their breath: thus did he stand, the sublime one, and in silence:</p><p>O’erhung with ugly truths, the spoil of his hunting, and rich in torn raiment; many thorns also hung on him—but I saw no rose.</p></div> </div>
