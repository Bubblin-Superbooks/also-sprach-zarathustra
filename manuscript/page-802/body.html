Who is to be master of the world?</p><p>The moon is cool, the wind is still. Ah! Ah! Have ye already flown high enough? Ye have danced: a leg, nevertheless, is not a wing.</p><p>Ye good dancers, now is all delight over: wine hath become lees, every cup hath become brittle, the sepulchres mutter.</p><p>Ye have not flown high enough: now do the sepulchres mutter: “Free the dead! Why is it so long night? Doth not the moon make us drunken?”</p></div> </div>
