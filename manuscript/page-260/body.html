<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">will we raise an outcry!”</p><p>Ye preachers of equality, the tyrant-frenzy of impotence crieth thus in you for “equality”: your most secret tyrant-longings disguise themselves thus in virtue-words!</p><p>Fretted conceit and suppressed envy—perhaps your fathers’ conceit and envy: in you break they forth as flame and frenzy of vengeance.</p><p>What the father hath hid cometh out in the son; and oft have I found in the son the father’s revealed secret.</p><p>Inspired ones they resemble: but it is not the heart that inspireth them—but vengeance. And when they become subtle and cold, it is not spirit, but envy, that maketh them so.</p><p>Their jealousy leadeth them also into thinkers’ paths; and this is the sign of their jealousy—they always go too far: so that their fatigue hath at last to go to sleep on the snow.</p></div> </div>
