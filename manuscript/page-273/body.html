And my soul also is a gushing fountain.</p><p>‘Tis night: now only do all songs of the loving ones awake.

A craving for love is within me, which speaketh itself the language of love.</p><p>Light am I: ah, that I were night! But it is my lonesomeness to be begirt with light!</p><p>Ah, that I were dark and nightly! How would I suck at the breasts of light!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And you yourselves would I bless, ye twinkling</p></div> </div>
