<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>A truth which only glideth into fine ears, he calleth falsehood and trumpery. Verily, he believeth only in Gods that make a great noise in the world!</p><p>Full of clattering buffoons is the market-place,â€”and the people glory in their great men! These are for them the masters of the hour.</p><p>But the hour presseth them; so they press thee. And also from thee they want Yea or Nay. Alas! thou wouldst set thy chair betwixt For and Against?</p><p>On account of those absolute and impatient ones, be not jealous, thou lover of truth! Never yet did truth cling to the arm of an absolute one.</p><p>On account of those abrupt ones, return into thy security: only in the market-place is one assailed by Yea? or Nay?</p><p>Slow is the experience of all deep fountains: long have they to wait until they know WHAT hath fallen into their depths.</p></div> </div>
