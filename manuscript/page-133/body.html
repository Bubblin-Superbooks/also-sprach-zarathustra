Are ye not very ripe for the sermon of death?</p><p>All ye to whom rough labour is dear, and the rapid, new, and strange—ye put up with yourselves badly; your diligence is flight, and the will to self-forgetfulness.</p><p>If ye believed more in life, then would ye devote yourselves less to the momentary.
