<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Verily, not as creators, as procreators, or as jubilators do ye love the earth!</p><p>Where is innocence? Where there is will to procreation. And he who seeketh to create beyond himself, hath for me the purest will.</p><p>Where is beauty? Where I MUST WILL with my whole Will; where I will love and perish, that an image may not remain merely an image.</p><p>Loving and perishing: these have rhymed from eternity. Will to love: that is to be ready also for death. Thus do I speak unto you cowards!</p><p>But now doth your emasculated ogling profess to be “contemplation!” And that which can be examined with cowardly eyes is to be christened “beautiful!” Oh, ye violators of noble names!</p><p>But it shall be your curse, ye immaculate ones, ye pure discerners, that ye shall never bring forth, even though ye lie broad and teeming on the horizon!</p></div> </div>
