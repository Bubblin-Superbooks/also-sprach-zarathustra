And yet—how little was lacking for them to caress each other, that dog and that lonesome one! Are they not both—lonesome ones!”</p><p>---“Whoever thou art,” said the trodden one, still enraged, “thou treadest also too nigh me with thy parable, and not only with thy foot!</p><p>Lo! am I then a dog?”—And thereupon the sitting one got up, and pulled his naked arm out of the swamp. For at first he had lain outstretched on the ground, hidden and indiscernible, like those who lie in wait for swamp-game.</p></div> </div>
