Flatterers are they, and whimperers, and nothing more.</p><p>Often, also, do they show themselves to thee as amiable ones. But that hath ever been the prudence of the cowardly.

Whatever is much thought about is at last thought suspicious.</p><p>They punish thee for all thy virtues. They pardon thee in their inmost hearts only—for thine errors.</p><p>Because thou art gentle and of upright character, thou sayest: “Blameless are they for their small existence.” But their circumscribed souls think: “Blamable is all great existence.”</p><p>Even when thou art gentle towards them, they still feel themselves despised by thee; and they repay thy beneficence with secret maleficence.</p></div> </div>
