Steameth not this city with the fumes of slaughtered spirit?</p><p>Seest thou not the souls hanging like limp dirty rags?—And they make newspapers also out of these rags!</p><p>Hearest thou not how spirit hath here become a verbal game? Loathsome verbal swill doth it vomit forth!—And they make newspapers also out of this verbal swill.</p></div> </div>
