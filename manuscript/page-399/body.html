<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>For in one’s heart one loveth only one’s child and one’s work; and where there is great love to oneself, then is it the sign of pregnancy: so have I found it.</p><p>Still are my children verdant in their first spring, standing nigh one another, and shaken in common by the winds, the trees of my garden and of my best soil.</p><p>And verily, where such trees stand beside one another, there ARE Happy Isles!</p><p>But one day will I take them up, and put each by itself alone: that it may learn lonesomeness and defiance and prudence.</p><p>Gnarled and crooked and with flexible hardness shall it then stand by the sea, a living lighthouse of unconquerable life.</p><p>Yonder where the storms rush down into the sea, and the snout of the mountain drinketh water, shall each on a time have his day and night watches, for HIS testing and recognition.</p></div> </div>
