For only he who is man enough, will—SAVE THE WOMAN in woman.</p><p>And this hypocrisy found I worst amongst them, that even those who command feign the virtues of those who serve.</p><p>“I serve, thou servest, we serve”—so chanteth here even the hypocrisy of the rulers—and alas! if the first lord be ONLY the first servant!</p><p>Ah, even upon their hypocrisy did mine eyes’ curiosity alight; and well did I divine all their fly-happiness, and their buzzing around sunny window-panes.</p><p>So much kindness, so much weakness do I see. So much justice and pity, so much weakness.</p><p>Round, fair, and considerate are they to one another, as grains of sand are round, fair, and considerate to grains of sand.</p></div> </div>
