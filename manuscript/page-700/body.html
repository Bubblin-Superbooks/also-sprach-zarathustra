And if ye appertain to me, still it is not as my right arm.</p><p>For he who himself standeth, like you, on sickly and tender legs, wisheth above all to be TREATED INDULGENTLY, whether he be conscious of it or hide it from himself.</p><p>My arms and my legs, however, I do not treat indulgently, I DO NOT TREAT MY WARRIORS INDULGENTLY: how then could ye be fit for MY warfare?</p><p>With you I should spoil all my victories. And many of you would tumble over if ye but heard the loud beating of my drums.</p><p>Moreover, ye are not sufficiently beautiful and well-born for me. I require pure, smooth mirrors for my doctrines; on your surface even mine own likeness is distorted.</p></div> </div>
