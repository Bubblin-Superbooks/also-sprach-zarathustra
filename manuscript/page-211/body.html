At last he spake thusâ€”and his voice had changed:</p><p>I now go alone, my disciples! Ye also now go away, and alone! So will I have it.</p><p>Verily, I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathustra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he hath deceived you.</p><p>The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but also to hate his friends.</p></div> </div>
