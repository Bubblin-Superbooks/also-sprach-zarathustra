<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Away from the market-place and from fame taketh place all that is great: away from the market-Place and from fame have ever dwelt the devisers of new values.</p><p>Flee, my friend, into thy solitude: I see thee stung all over by the poisonous flies. Flee thither, where a rough, strong breeze bloweth!</p><p>Flee into thy solitude! Thou hast lived too closely to the small and the pitiable. Flee from their invisible vengeance! Towards thee they have nothing but vengeance.</p><p>Raise no longer an arm against them! Innumerable are they, and it is not thy lot to be a fly-flap.</p><p>Innumerable are the small and pitiable ones; and of many a proud structure, rain-drops and weeds have been the ruin.</p><p>Thou art not stone; but already hast thou become hollow by the numerous drops. Thou wilt yet break and burst by the numerous drops.</p></div> </div>
