There is there much right, much wrong: he who looketh on becometh wroth.</p><p>Therein viewing, therein hewing—they are the same thing: therefore depart into the forests and lay your sword to sleep!</p><p>Go YOUR ways! and let the people and peoples go theirs!—gloomy ways, verily, on which not a single hope glinteth any more!</p><p>Let there the trader rule, where all that still glittereth is—traders’ gold. It is the time of kings no longer: that which now calleth itself the people is unworthy of kings.</p><p>See how these peoples themselves now do just like the traders: they pick up the smallest advantage out of all kinds of rubbish!</p></div> </div>
