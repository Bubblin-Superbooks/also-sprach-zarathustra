<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>One requiteth a teacher badly if one remain merely a scholar. And why will ye not pluck at my wreath?</p><p>Ye venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day collapse? Take heed lest a statue crush you!</p><p>Ye say, ye believe in Zarathustra? But of what account is Zarathustra! Ye are my believers: but of what account are all believers!</p><p>Ye had not yet sought yourselves: then did ye find me. So do all believers; therefore all belief is of so little account.</p><p>Now do I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when ye have all denied me, will I return unto you.</p><p>Verily, with other eyes, my brethren, shall I then seek my lost ones; with another love shall I then love you.</p><p>And once again shall ye have become friends unto me, and children of one hope: then will I be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great noontide with you.</p></div> </div>
