<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">forgot she thereby, as it seem’th to me,
   The OTHER leg?
   For vainly I, at least,
   Did search for the amissing
   Fellow-jewel
   —Namely, the other leg—
   In the sanctified precincts,
   Nigh her very dearest, very tenderest,
   Flapping and fluttering and flickering skirting.
   Yea, if ye should, ye beauteous friendly ones,
   Quite take my word:
   She hath, alas! LOST it!
   Hu!  Hu!  Hu!  Hu!  Hu!
   It is away!
   For ever away!
   The other leg!
   Oh, pity for that loveliest other leg!
   Where may it now tarry, all-forsaken weeping?
   The lonesomest leg?
   In fear perhaps before a
   Furious, yellow, blond and curled
   Leonine monster?  Or perhaps even
   Gnawed away, nibbled badly—
   Most wretched, woeful! woeful! nibbled badly!  Selah.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Oh, weep ye not,
   Gentle spirits!
   Weep ye not, ye
   Date-fruit spirits!  Milk-bosoms!
   Ye sweetwood-heart
   Purselets!
