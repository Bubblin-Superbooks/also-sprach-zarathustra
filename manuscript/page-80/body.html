<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>But I part from thee; the time hath arrived. â€˜Twixt rosy dawn and rosy dawn there came unto me a new truth.</p><p>I am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger. Not any more will I discourse unto the people; for the last time have I spoken unto the dead.</p><p>With the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers will I associate: the rainbow will I show them, and all the stairs to the Superman.</p><p>To the lone-dwellers will I sing my song, and to the twain-dwellers; and unto him who hath still ears for the unheard, will I make the heart heavy with my happiness.</p><p>I make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering and tardy will I leap. Thus let my on-going be their down-going!</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
