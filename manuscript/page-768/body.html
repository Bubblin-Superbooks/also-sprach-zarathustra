<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Wonderful, truly!
   Here do I sit now,
   The desert nigh, and yet I am
   So far still from the desert,
   Even in naught yet deserted:
   That is, I’m swallowed down
   By this the smallest oasis—:
   —It opened up just yawning,
   Its loveliest mouth agape,
   Most sweet-odoured of all mouthlets:
   Then fell I right in,
   Right down, right through—in ‘mong you,
   Ye friendly damsels dearly loved!  Selah.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Hail! hail! to that whale, fishlike,
   If it thus for its guest’s convenience
   Made things nice!—(ye well know,
   Surely, my learned allusion?)
   Hail to its belly,
   If it had e’er
   A such loveliest oasis-belly
   As this is:  though however I doubt about it,
   —With this come I out of Old-Europe,
   That doubt’th more eagerly than doth any
   Elderly married woman.
   May the Lord improve it!
   Amen!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
