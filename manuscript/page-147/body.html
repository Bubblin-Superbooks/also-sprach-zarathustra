I see thee deafened with the noise of the great men, and stung all over with the stings of the little ones.</p><p>Admirably do forest and rock know how to be silent with thee. Resemble again the tree which thou lovest, the broad-branched one—silently and attentively it o’erhangeth the sea.</p><p>Where solitude endeth, there beginneth the market-place; and where the market-place beginneth, there beginneth also the noise of the great actors, and the buzzing of the poison-flies.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In the world even the best things are worthless</p></div> </div>
