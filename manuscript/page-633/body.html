   —Of what, pray, ever jealous?
   Off!  Off!
   For why the ladder?
   Wouldst thou GET IN?
   To heart in-clamber?
   To mine own secretest
   Conceptions in-clamber?
   Shameless one!  Thou unknown one!—Thief!
   What seekst thou by thy stealing?
   What seekst thou by thy hearkening?
   What seekst thou by thy torturing?
   Thou torturer!
   Thou—hangman-God!
   Or shall I, as the mastiffs do,
   Roll me before thee?
   And cringing, enraptured, frantical,
   My tail friendly—waggle!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   In vain!
   Goad further!
   Cruellest goader!
   No dog—thy game just am I,
   Cruellest huntsman!
   Thy proudest of captives,
   Thou robber ‘hind the cloud-banks...
   Speak finally!
   Thou lightning-veiled one!  Thou unknown one!  Speak!
   What wilt thou, highway-ambusher, from—ME?
   What WILT thou, unfamiliar—God?
   What?
