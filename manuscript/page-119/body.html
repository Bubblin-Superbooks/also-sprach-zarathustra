Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit.</p><p>It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.</p><p>He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another century of readersâ€”and spirit itself will stink.</p><p>Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not only writing but also thinking.</p><p>Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace.</p></div> </div>
