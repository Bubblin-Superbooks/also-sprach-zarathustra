   Pallid Dudu!
   Be a man, Suleika!  Bold!  Bold!
   —Or else should there perhaps
   Something strengthening, heart-strengthening,
   Here most proper be?
   Some inspiring text?
   Some solemn exhortation?—
   Ha!  Up now! honour!
   Moral honour!  European honour!
   Blow again, continue,
   Bellows-box of virtue!
   Ha!
   Once more thy roaring,
   Thy moral roaring!
   As a virtuous lion
   Nigh the daughters of deserts roaring!
   —For virtue’s out-howl,
   Ye very dearest maidens,
   Is more than every
   European fervour, European hot-hunger!
   And now do I stand here,
   As European,
   I can’t be different, God’s help to me!
   Amen!</p></blockquote><p>THE DESERTS GROW: WOE HIM WHO DOTH THEM HIDE!</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
