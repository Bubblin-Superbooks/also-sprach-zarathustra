Much, verily, doth it seem to me for such a one, if he should be the husband of one or of two or of three women.</p><p>And if he founded monasteries, and inscribed over their portals: “The way to holiness,”—I should still say: What good is it! it is a new folly!</p><p>He hath founded for himself a penance-house and refuge-house: much good may it do! But I do not believe in it.</p><p>In solitude there groweth what any one bringeth into it—also the brute in one’s nature. Thus is solitude inadvisable unto many.</p><p>Hath there ever been anything filthier on earth than the saints of the wilderness?
