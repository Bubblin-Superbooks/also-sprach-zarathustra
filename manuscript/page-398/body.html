<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">time:—at the hour when all light becometh stiller.</p><p>For whatever happiness is still on its way ‘twixt heaven and earth, now seeketh for lodging a luminous soul: WITH HAPPINESS hath all light now become stiller.</p><p>O afternoon of my life! Once did my happiness also descend to the valley that it might seek a lodging: then did it find those open hospitable souls.</p><p>O afternoon of my life! What did I not surrender that I might have one thing: this living plantation of my thoughts, and this dawn of my highest hope!</p><p>Companions did the creating one once seek, and children of HIS hope: and lo, it turned out that he could not find them, except he himself should first create them.</p><p>Thus am I in the midst of my work, to my children going, and from them returning: for the sake of his children must Zarathustra perfect himself.</p></div> </div>
