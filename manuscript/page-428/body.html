On The Olive-mount.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Winter, a bad guest, sitteth with me at home; blue are my hands with his friendly hand-shaking.</p><p>I honour him, that bad guest, but gladly leave him alone. Gladly do I run away from him; and when one runneth WELL, then one escapeth him!</p><p>With warm feet and warm thoughts do I run where the wind is calmâ€”to the sunny corner of mine olive-mount.</p><p>There do I laugh at my stern guest, and am still fond of him; because he cleareth my house of flies, and quieteth many little noises.</p></div> </div>
