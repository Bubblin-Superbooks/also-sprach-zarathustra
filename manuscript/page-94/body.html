And verily, if life had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this would be the desirablest nonsense for me also.</p><p>Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else when they sought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought for themselves, and poppy-head virtues to promote it!</p><p>To all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep without dreams: they knew no higher significance of life.</p><p>Even at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is past. And not much longer do they stand: there they already lie.</p><p>Blessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to sleep.â€”</p><p>Thus spake Zarathustra.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
