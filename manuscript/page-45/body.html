When he entered the forest, however, there suddenly stood before him an old man, who had left his holy cot to seek roots. And thus spake the old man to Zarathustra:</p><p>“No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed he by. Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.</p><p>Then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt thou now carry thy fire into the valleys? Fearest thou not the incendiary’s doom?</p></div> </div>
