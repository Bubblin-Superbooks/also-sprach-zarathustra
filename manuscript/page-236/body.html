The Priests.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">And one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples, and spake these words unto them:</p><p>“Here are priests: but although they are mine enemies, pass them quietly and with sleeping swords!</p><p>Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too much—: so they want to make others suffer.</p><p>Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness. And readily doth he soil himself who toucheth them.</p><p>But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood honoured in theirs.”—</p></div> </div>
