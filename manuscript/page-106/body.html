<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>To the despisers of the body will I speak a word. That they despise is caused by their esteem. What is it that created esteeming and despising and worth and will?</p><p>The creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, it created for itself joy and woe. The creating body created for itself spirit, as a hand to its will.</p><p>Even in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, ye despisers of the body. I tell you, your very Self wanteth to die, and turneth away from life.</p><p>No longer can your Self do that which it desireth most:—create beyond itself. That is what it desireth most; that is all its fervour.</p><p>But it is now too late to do so:—so your Self wisheth to succumb, ye despisers of the body.</p><p>To succumb—so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye become despisers of the body. For ye can no longer create beyond yourselves.</p></div> </div>
