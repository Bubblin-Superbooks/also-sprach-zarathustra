Scholars.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">When I lay asleep, then did a sheep eat at the ivy-wreath on my head,—it ate, and said thereby: “Zarathustra is no longer a scholar.”</p><p>It said this, and went away clumsily and proudly. A child told it to me.</p><p>I like to lie here where the children play, beside the ruined wall, among thistles and red poppies.</p><p>A scholar am I still to the children, and also to the thistles and red poppies. Innocent are they, even in their wickedness.</p><p>But to the sheep I am no longer a scholar: so willeth my lot—blessings upon it!</p></div> </div>
