A physician? Or a healed one?</p><p>Is he a poet? Or a genuine one? An emancipator? Or a subjugator? A good one? Or an evil one?</p><p>I walk amongst men as the fragments of the future: that future which I contemplate.</p><p>And it is all my poetisation and aspiration to compose and collect into unity what is fragment and riddle and fearful chance.</p></div> </div>
