Wouldst thou seek the way unto thyself? Tarry yet a little and hearken unto me.</p><p>“He who seeketh may easily get lost himself. All isolation is wrong”: so say the herd. And long didst thou belong to the herd.</p><p>The voice of the herd will still echo in thee. And when thou sayest, “I have no longer a conscience in common with you,” then will it be a plaint and a pain.</p><p>Lo, that pain itself did the same conscience produce; and the last gleam of that conscience still gloweth on thine affliction.</p></div> </div>
