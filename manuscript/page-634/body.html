   Who lov’th me still?—
   Give ardent fingers
   Give heartening charcoal-warmers,
   Give me, the lonesomest,
   The ice (ah! seven-fold frozen ice
   For very enemies,
   For foes, doth make one thirst).
   Give, yield to me,
   Cruellest foe,
   —THYSELF!—</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Away!
