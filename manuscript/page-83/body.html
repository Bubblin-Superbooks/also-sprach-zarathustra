The Three Metamorphoses.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.</p><p>Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing spirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest longeth its strength.</p><p>What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden.</p><p>What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.</p></div> </div>
