It is bad to live in cities: there, there are too many of the lustful.</p><p>Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer, than into the dreams of a lustful woman?</p><p>And just look at these men: their eye saith it—they know nothing better on earth than to lie with a woman.</p><p>Filth is at the bottom of their souls; and alas! if their filth hath still spirit in it!</p><p>Would that ye were perfect—at least as animals! But to animals belongeth innocence.</p><p>Do I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to innocence in your instincts.</p></div> </div>
