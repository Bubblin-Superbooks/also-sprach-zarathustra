<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Too sweet fruits—these the warrior liketh not. Therefore liketh he woman;—bitter is even the sweetest woman.</p><p>Better than man doth woman understand children, but man is more childish than woman.</p><p>In the true man there is a child hidden: it wanteth to play. Up then, ye women, and discover the child in man!</p><p>A plaything let woman be, pure and fine like the precious stone, illumined with the virtues of a world not yet come.</p><p>Let the beam of a star shine in your love! Let your hope say: “May I bear the Superman!”</p><p>In your love let there be valour! With your love shall ye assail him who inspireth you with fear!</p><p>In your love be your honour! Little doth woman understand otherwise about honour. But let this be your honour: always to love more than ye are loved, and never be the second.</p></div> </div>
