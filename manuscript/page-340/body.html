The best turned weary of their works.</p><p>A doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: ‘All is empty, all is alike, all hath been!’</p><p>And from all hills there re-echoed: ‘All is empty, all is alike, all hath been!’</p><p>To be sure we have harvested: but why have all our fruits become rotten and brown? What was it fell last night from the evil moon?</p><p>In vain was all our labour, poison hath our wine become, the evil eye hath singed yellow our fields and hearts.</p></div> </div>
