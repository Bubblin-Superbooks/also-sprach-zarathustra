And what in the world hath caused more suffering than the follies of the pitiful?</p><p>Woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their pity!</p><p>Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: “Even God hath his hell: it is his love for man.”</p><p>And lately, did I hear him say these words: “God is dead: of his pity for man hath God died.”—</p><p>So be ye warned against pity: FROM THENCE there yet cometh unto men a heavy cloud!
