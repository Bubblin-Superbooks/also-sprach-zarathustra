But thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom.</p><p>Thy wild dogs want liberty; they bark for joy in their cellar when thy spirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors.</p><p>Still art thou a prisoner—it seemeth to me—who deviseth liberty for himself: ah! sharp becometh the soul of such prisoners, but also deceitful and wicked.</p><p>To purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of the spirit. Much of the prison and the mould still remaineth in him: pure hath his eye still to become.</p><p>Yea, I know thy danger.
