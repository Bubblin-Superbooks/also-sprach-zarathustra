It is no longer worth while to live, everything is indifferent, everything is useless: or else—we must live with Zarathustra!’</p><p>‘Why doth he not come who hath so long announced himself?’ thus do many people ask; ‘hath solitude swallowed him up? Or should we perhaps go to him?’</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Now doth it come to pass that solitude itself</p></div> </div>
