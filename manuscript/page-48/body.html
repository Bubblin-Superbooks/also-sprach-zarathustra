But what dost thou bring us as a gift?”</p><p>When Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the saint and said: “What should I have to give thee! Let me rather hurry hence lest I take aught away from thee!”—And thus they parted from one another, the old man and Zarathustra, laughing like schoolboys.</p><p>When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: “Could it be possible!
