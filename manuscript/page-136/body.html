And with some of you there is hatred at first sight.</p><p>Your enemy shall ye seek; your war shall ye wage, and for the sake of your thoughts! And if your thoughts succumb, your uprightness shall still shout triumph thereby!</p><p>Ye shall love peace as a means to new wars—and the short peace more than the long.</p><p>You I advise not to work, but to fight. You I advise not to peace, but to victory. Let your work be a fight, let your peace be a victory!</p><p>One can only be silent and sit peacefully when one hath arrow and bow; otherwise one prateth and quarrelleth. Let your peace be a victory!</p></div> </div>
