But the one behind followed after him, so that immediately there were three runners, one after the other—namely, foremost the voluntary beggar, then Zarathustra, and thirdly, and hindmost, his shadow. But not long had they run thus when Zarathustra became conscious of his folly, and shook off with one jerk all his irritation and detestation.</p><p>“What!” said he, “have not the most ludicrous things always happened to us old anchorites and saints?</p><p>Verily, my folly hath grown big in the mountains! Now do I hear six old fools’ legs rattling behind one another!</p><p>But doth Zarathustra need to be frightened by his shadow? Also, methinketh that after all it hath longer legs than mine.”</p></div> </div>
