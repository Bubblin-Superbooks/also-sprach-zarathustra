Ah, ofttimes became I weary of spirit, when I found even the rabble spiritual!</p><p>And on the rulers turned I my back, when I saw what they now call ruling: to traffic and bargain for powerâ€”with the rabble!</p><p>Amongst peoples of a strange language did I dwell, with stopped ears: so that the language of their trafficking might remain strange unto me, and their bargaining for power.</p><p>And holding my nose, I went morosely through all yesterdays and to-days: verily, badly smell all yesterdays and to-days of the scribbling rabble!</p></div> </div>
