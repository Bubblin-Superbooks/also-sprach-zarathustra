<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>For this is the truth: I have departed from the house of the scholars, and the door have I also slammed behind me.</p><p>Too long did my soul sit hungry at their table: not like them have I got the knack of investigating, as the knack of nut-cracking.</p><p>Freedom do I love, and the air over fresh soil; rather would I sleep on ox-skins than on their honours and dignities.</p><p>I am too hot and scorched with mine own thought: often is it ready to take away my breath. Then have I to go into the open air, and away from all dusty rooms.</p><p>But they sit cool in the cool shade: they want in everything to be merely spectators, and they avoid sitting where the sun burneth on the steps.</p><p>Like those who stand in the street and gape at the passers-by: thus do they also wait, and gape at the thoughts which others have thought.</p></div> </div>
