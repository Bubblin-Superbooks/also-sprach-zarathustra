<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">chariot, O storm, do I leap! And even thee will I whip with my spite!</p><p>Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Happy Isles where my friends sojourn;—</p><p>And mine enemies amongst them! How I now love every one unto whom I may but speak! Even mine enemies pertain to my bliss.</p><p>And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then doth my spear always help me up best: it is my foot’s ever ready servant:—</p><p>The spear which I hurl at mine enemies! How grateful am I to mine enemies that I may at last hurl it!</p><p>Too great hath been the tension of my cloud: ‘twixt laughters of lightnings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.</p><p>Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm over the mountains: thus cometh its assuagement.</p></div> </div>
