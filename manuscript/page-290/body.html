Ever livest thou there, and art like thyself, thou most patient one! Ever hast thou burst all shackles of the tomb!</p><p>In thee still liveth also the unrealisedness of my youth; and as life and youth sittest thou here hopeful on the yellow ruins of graves.</p><p>Yea, thou art still for me the demolisher of all graves: Hail to thee, my Will!
